        <h2>In-depth Description</h2>
        <p>When a ui directive is made, it creates it in the <mark>src/ui/app/directives</mark> folder. This will create a js controller that is used like a typical angular directive.</p>
        <p>Let's say we generate a directive called 'color-me'. To use it on an html tag:</p>
        <code-example type="html" code="vm.getCodeSample1()"></code-example>
        <p>Angular will then initialize the color-me directive whenever the page is loaded with that input.</p>
