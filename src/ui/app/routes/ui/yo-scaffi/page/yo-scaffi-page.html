        <h2>In-depth Description</h2>
        <p>When a ui page is made, Scaffi creates it in the <mark>src/ui/app/routes/**/*</mark> folder, based on the route you provide it. This will give you an html and js controller. Because of how things are structured, the page will be accessible via url once it's created.</p>
        <p>If you say you want to get a split controller between mobile and web, Scaffi will make two controllers, ending in *.mobile.js and *.web.js respectively. This will allow you to specify platform-specific logic.</p>
