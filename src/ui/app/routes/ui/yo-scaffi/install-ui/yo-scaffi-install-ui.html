        <h2>In-depth Description</h2>
        <p class="alert">!!! We don't want to use <mark>npm install *</mark> directly anymore, because there are processes in the framework that keep everything in-sync for not only the build, but for everyone on the project. Always use one of the <mark>yo scaffi:install-*</mark> commands when adding a package. !!!</p>
        <p>This command is used if you want to install npm/github packages that will be used in all platform builds, from mobile to web. Use it like you would <mark>npm install</mark>.</p>
        <p>Otherwise it's just a typical Angular inject like normal:</p>
