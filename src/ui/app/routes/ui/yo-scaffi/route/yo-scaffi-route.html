        <h2>In-depth Description</h2>
        <p>When a ui route is made, Scaffi creates it in the <mark>src/ui/app/routes/**/*</mark> folder. If you provide the cli a route, it will create the new route in a nested location. This will give you a js ui-router controller, as well as a page index. Because of how things are structured, the page will be accessible via url once it's created.</p>
        <p>If you say you want to get a split controller between mobile and web, Scaffi will make two controllers, ending in *.mobile.js and *.web.js respectively. This will allow you to specify platform-specific logic.</p>
