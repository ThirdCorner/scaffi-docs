        <h2>In-depth Description</h2>
        <p class="alert">!!! We don't want to use <mark>npm install *</mark> directly anymore, because there are processes in the framework that keep everything in-sync for not only the build, but for everyone on the project. Always use one of the <mark>yo scaffi:install-*</mark> commands when adding a package. !!!</p>
        <p>This command is used if you want to install npm/github packages that will only be used for web builds. Use it like you would <mark>npm install</mark>.</p>
        <p>This is how you inject into Angular. Let's say we only want to use ng-table in web. In <mark>src/ui/app/theme/theme.js</mark> we would do something like this::</p>

        <code-example type="javascript" code="vm.getCodeSample1()"></code-example>

        <p>The <mark>import 'ng-table';</mark> will be imported into the vendor.js file for any web build, while being excluded from all mobile builds.</p>
