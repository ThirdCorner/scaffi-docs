        <h2>In-depth Description</h2>
        <p>When a ui service is made, Scaffi creates it in the <mark>src/ui/app/services</mark> folder. This is a traditional Angular service which you can inject in your page or component controllers. Scaffi also generates a mock service (for prototype mode if you need to override certain calls) and a fixture file to store structures for prototype and documetation usages.</p>
