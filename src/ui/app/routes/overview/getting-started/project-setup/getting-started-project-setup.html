        <h2>Let's make a project</h2>
        <p>Scaffi has a lot of baked-in structure in the framework, so it leverages Yeoman to handle any file generation; this saves us the hassle of copy/pasting files whenever we’re adding something to a project. Scaffi even comes with a generator to scaffold out a new project so let’s do that. In a CMD window, navigate to your projects directory (or wherever you want to store this tutorial project). Once you’re there, run the following:</p>

        <p class="command">yo scaffi</p>

        <p>This will start Yeoman and run you through project creation. For the sake of this tutorial, do the following so we can have a basis to work with:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Hit enter at the first prompt</li>
            <li>Hit enter at <span class="code">“New Project/Add to Project”</span></li>
            <li>Hit enter for <span class="code">“Both”</span></li>
            <li>Project Name: <span class="code">rocking-form</span></li>
            <li>Add your name</li>
            <li>Type <span class="code">“api”</span> (This is setting up the base route, as in where to direct all api server requests when not in prototype mode made by the UI)</li>
            <li>Hit enter for defaults (If we had a database/api that we have to hook into, we might customize here to tell Scaffi how to parse data structures coming in from the server)</li>
            <li>This will now run npm install on the UI and the Server. Go get coffee, this will take a bit.</li>
            <li>Once that’s all installed, it’s going to have you pick a theme. Again, hit enter and then select <span class="code">Angular Material</span> (Scaffi can do both material and bootstrap, so you’d pick whichever you need for your project. But, material is definitely worth it if you can use it)</li>
            <li>Select <span class="code">"basic"</span> when it asks you what type of page you want to make.</li>
            <li>Type <code>n</code> and hit enter when it asks "Do you need separate controllers for web and mobile"</li>
        </ol>
        <p>After all that installation and setup, you should be back at the CMD prompt. Type the following:</p>

        <p class="command">
            cmd rocking-form <br>
            yo scaffi:mode prototype
        </p>

        <p>This command is for switching between various environment modes. Everything but prototype mode expects a backend service to talk to.</p>
        <p>To start the UI, in your CMD window, run the following:</p>

        <p class="command">yo scaffi:start web</p>

        <p>If all was good with your setup, the build process will kick off. Give it a minute and it’ll launch a browser tab going to <a href="http://localhost:4000">http://localhost:4000</a>. It should look like this: </p>
        <img src="images/getting-started-project-1st.png" />

        <p>Congrats. You now have a fully scaffolded template project to edit to your hearts content. Let’s dig into this whole prototype mode thingymajigger.</p>

        <p>In your favorite IDE, open up the project source that got generated. We only care about the UI code right now, so take a look in <span class="code">rocking-form/src/ui</span>. Should look like a standard project setup, except with maybe a couple more json files than you’re used to. The angular app source is in the <span class="code">app</span> folder, in which you will see your typical angular module concepts. Once you’ve taken a look around, let’s highlight some distinctions that Scaffi makes:</p>

        <ul class="list">
            <li><label>components</label>These are html tag type components, like a date picker, that are used throughout the app in an html template.</li>
            <li><label>directives</label> These are html tag attribute components. These don’t have a template associated with them.</li>
            <li><label>factories</label> These are general singleton classes in your app that you can call. For instance, an ErrorHandling class would be a factory, since you want to be able to use it in any controller throughout your app.</li>
            <li><label>routes</label> Where all your pages and their controllers live. The structure of the routes folder will match your browser url. If you had a url <span class="code">localhost:4000/products/edit</span>, your file path in routes would look like <span class="code">routes/products/edit/index</span>. The homepage is in the <span class="code">routes/index</span> folder.</li>
            <li><label>services</label> These are your http calls to your server and any other external systems you might need to hook up to. Services have classic REST commands (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) as well as a few others (LIST).</li>
            <li><label>theme</label> Where your header, footer, layout, and styles are all grouped. Sass styles are all in <span class="code">theme/styles</span> folder so put all your custom layout design in that thar place.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Concepts are boring though so let’s edit the things!</p>
