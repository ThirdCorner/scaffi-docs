        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
        <p>This tutorial is meant to showcase the workflow involved with using Scaffi. Scaffi is a non-traditional library that allows programming on the UI to happen without the need for a server. An overview of a general project flow is as follows:</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>
               <b>Wireframe / Mockup Stage</b> <br>This stage is where all the white-boarding and requirements-gathering happens. This is the time to document the expected functionality the app should adhere to. No coding should be done at this stage.
            </li>
            <li><b>Prototype Stage</b>: <br>This is when coding begins. By running the app in prototype mode, the UI mimics classic CRUD structure and stores data in browser memory. This allows for you to bake in as much front-end logic as possible into the app without needing to upkeep a backend. You can code all your UI logic, let the client see and play around with the app, and fully solidify acceptance criteria. If changes need to happen, it’s much easier to change just the UI. Traditionally, you'd have to make changes to the UI and backend depending on the request.</li>
            <li><b>Server Stage</b>: <br>Once the prototype has been signed off as meeting all functional front-end requirements, we move onto the server stage. Because we’ve already went through rounds of changes with the client by this point, you’ll have a thorough understanding of what data structures you need the backend to store. By this point, all you'll need to do is build the schema for the database and the CRUD structures. Scaffi Server leverages certain packages so that even the controller construction level of effort is reduced significantly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This tutorial will walk you through how this workflow happens so you can get a good grasp of the logistics.</p>
