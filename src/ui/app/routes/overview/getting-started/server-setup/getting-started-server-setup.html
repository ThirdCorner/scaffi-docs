        <h1>Server Setup</h1>
        <p>For the sake of this tutorial, let’s assume we’ve met our requirements: Grouping of products of active vs complete and the ability to add and edit them.</p>
        <p>Before we start this, make sure you have:</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Localhost sql instance to connect to</li>
            <li>Have admin read/write creds attached to a DB called RockingForm</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For streamlining connections from UI to Database, we’re using Sequelize (<a href="http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest/">http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest/</a>) which comes with some spiffy packages to make integration easy-peasy.</p>
        <p>First and foremost, let’s switch out of prototype mode:</p>
        <p class="command">yo scaffi:mode</p>
        <p>Be sure to select <b>localhost</b> as the new mode to work in.</p>
        <p>Before we start things up, open up "/src/server/scaffi-server.json". Since we’re connecting to sql, make the components object look like so:</p>

        <code-example type="json" code="vm.getSampleData1()"></code-example>

        <p>This tells sequelize that we’re connecting to mssql, and that we’re using epilogue as an add-on, which we’ll get into later.</p>
        <p>In "/src/server/scaffi-server.private.json", replace with the following:</p>

        <code-example type="json" code="vm.getSampleData2()"></code-example>

        <p>If you’re not using sqlexpress, take out the line with the instance. Otherwise, fill in the username and password with whatever account you have attached to the RockingForm DB.</p>

        <h2>Add a Table Schema</h2>
        <p>One last thing we want to do is add a products model that our UI is setup to manipulate.</p>
        <p>If you remember, we have a fixture in products-service.fixture.js on the UI side that looks like this:</p>

        <code-example type="json" code="vm.getSampleData3()"></code-example>

        <p>In "/src/server/models", make a JS file called "Products.js" (Name needs to match whatever table name it’s going to be in the exact casing). Paste the following:</p>

        <code-example type="javascript" code="vm.getSampleData4()"></code-example>

        <p>This is Sequelize's syntax for table schemas. Having the fixture in the UI makes it really easy to construct the table schema that the server will use. If you haven’t already, go into your DB and add this table schema to the actual database. </p>

        <p class="alert">!!! Because of the hassle of singular and plural table name mutation, in Scaffi, we freeze the table names so that we don’t have to deal with mutation in the name. So when you’re making tables, either go with singular or plural and stick with it in the UI and Server. We did “Products” in the UI so this table schema will reference the Products table. !!!</p>

        <p>With all those changes made, in a CMD window, you should be able to browse to src/server and run the command:</p>
        <p class="command">yo scaffi:start server</p>
        <p>If everything’s connected properly, you should see an output of:</p>

        <img src="/images/getting-started-server-1st.png" />

        <p>You should be able to browse to it in chrome and get the following:</p>

        <img src="/images/getting-started-server-2nd.png" />

        <p>If you're getting a sequelize error, go here because you need to configure a few more things: </p>

        <h2>Add a CRUD Route</h2>
        <p>We have our server talking with the database, now we need the server to set up a CRUD route for the UI’s products-service.service to use to talk to the database. With Sequelize comes Epilogue (<a href="https://github.com/dchester/epilogue">https://github.com/dchester/epilogue</a>). </p>
        <p>In "/src/server/routes" add a folder called "epilogue" if not there already. In that folder, create a JS file called "products.js" and paste the following:</p>

        <code-example type="javascript" code="vm.getSampleData5()"></code-example>

        <p>This sets up a classic REST route that the UI expects to be there. Go ahead and kill your npm process and then run 'yo scaffi:start server' on the server again. You can now browse to <a href="http://localhost:3000/api/products/">http://localhost:3000/api/products/</a> and get the following:</p>

        <img src="/images/getting-started-server-3rd.png" />

        <p>There’s no data in the database currently so this is expected.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>UI =&gt; Server =&gt; Database</h2>
        <p>Now’s the moment of truth: does the UI hook up to the DB and back like it should? Let’s test it out.</p>
        <p>While your npm server is still running, open a new CMD window, browser to the ui folder and run "yo scaffi:start ui". When a new page opens in your browser, remember to open the console and refresh the page. If we click the "Go to Products" link on the main page, it’ll bring us to our products section with no data. However, if you look at the Network tab, you’ll notice that it made a request to /api/products.</p>

        <img src="/images/getting-started-server-4th.png" />

        <p>This means it’s talking to that API Epilogue route that we just set up. Click “Add a product”, put in some data and let’s see if POSTs work. Once it goes back to the products page, we can see that our item was added.</p>

        <img src="/images/getting-started-server-5th.png" />

        <p>If we look at the database, we should have a row of data:</p>

        <img src="/images/getting-started-server-6th.png" />

        <p>One last thing to check is if our PUT route works. If we click on the item we just made, change and submit, we see that PUTs are hooked up as well:</p>

        <img src="/images/getting-started-server-7th.png" />

        <p>And that’s it. Integration is successfully setup from UI to Database and back, all without having to change anything in the UI to make it work.</p>
        <p>Hopefully you can see how powerful it is developing in prototype mode.</p>
