        <h1>Page Setup</h1>
        <p>We’re going to make a simple list / form section so you can get an idea of how cool prototype mode is. Kill your <span class="code">yo scaffi:start</span> process if you haven’t already <span class="code">(ctrl + c)</span> and let’s run some generators:</p>
        <p class="command">yo scaffi:service</p>

        <ul class="list">
            <li>Type <span class="code">products</span> for the name</li>
            <li>Select <span class="code">UI</span> for the service type</li>
            <li>Type <span class="code">products</span> for the REST route</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This creates an angular service that will call <span class="code">localhost:3000/api/products</span> when we're not in prototype mode. </p>
        <p>Let’s create a route as well, which in url terms is a sub-route grouping. </p>

        <p class="command">yo scaffi:route</p>

        <ul class="list">
            <li>Type <span class="code">products</span> for the name</li>
            <li>Type <span class="code">n</span> for no when it asks if this is a nested route</li>
            <li>Select <span class="code">basic</span> for the page template and hit enter</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This creates a url route on <span class="code">localhost:5010/products</span> that we can add pages to it. </p>
        <p>Before we start scaffi again, let’s go into <span class="code">rocking-form/src/ui/app/routes/products</span> in our IDE. You’ll notice it too has an index folder. When <span class="code">/products</span> or <span class="code">/products/</span> is called from the browser, this <span class="code">products/index/products-index.html</span> template page returns the content for that url. The controller for this template is <span class="code">products-index.page.js</span>.</p>

        <p>Open the <span class="code">products-index.html</span> page and paste this in:</p>

        <code-example type="html" code="vm.getSampleOne()"></code-example>
        <code-example type="html" code="vm.getSampleTwo()"></code-example>

        <p>Now let’s run ‘yo scaffi:start ui’, and when it’s loaded, refresh the page with the console open. It should now look like this:</p>
        <img src="/images/getting-started-project-2nd.png" />

        <p>If you click the link, it should take you to http://localhost:5010/products and look like so:</p>
        <img src="/images/getting-started-project-3rd.png" />

        <p>What this illustrates is that when you generate routes and pages with yo scaffi, the generators are handling ui-router setup for you. No more messing with confusing route setups, it’s all baked into the app structure. If you look in the routes/products/products.route.js, you can see that any call to “app.products” redirects to “app.products.index”, which is in the products/index/products-index.page.js controller. All ui-router routes start with “app.” so if you end up generating a series of routes where the url looks like products/overview/protected/edit, you can assume that the framework has added a ui-router call of app.products.overview.protected.edit that you can reference in your code with 100% surety. </p>

        <p>This is nice and spiffy, but this isn’t why we’re in prototype mode. </p>

        <p>In your products/index/products-index.html page (in Webstorm you can type CTRL+SHIFT+n to access the page really easy), change the html to this:</p>

        <code-example type="html" code="vm.getSampleThree()"></code-example>

        <p>A quick overview of this page is we have two sections that ng-repeats through an array called “products” that the controller page is providing. It filters based on if the product item has an IsComplete boolean of true or false with some added material flexbox goodness.</p>
        <p>In products/index/products-index.page.js, replace the contents with this:</p>

        <code-example type="javascript" code="vm.getSampleFour()"></code-example>

        <p>To give a high level view of this page, we’re importing stuff from Scaffi core and bringing in lodash. The ROUTE and PARAMS const that feed into @RouteConfig are what tell ui-router where to put this page in the router loading process.</p>

        <p>The resolve in that PARAMS object is making a fetch to the ProductsService class we generated above and is asking for all items from /api/products/. Because we’re in prototype mode, this won’t actually hit the server but it’s important to note it here. Because “ProductsService.get()” returns a promise, ui-router knows to wait for this promise to resolve before loading the controller.</p>

        <p>As for the actual ProductsIndex class, we’re setting the fetched products into the class and providing a few hook in functions for the products-index.html page. If all this syntax looks foreign to you, it’s ES6 syntax, which you can read up on at <a href="http://es6-features.org/">http://es6-features.org/</a>.</p>

        <p>If you remember with angular, if you set a variable to this.variable in the controller, in the template, it comes out as vm.variable. That’s why we have “this.products = products” in the constructor, but in our actual template, it comes out as “item in vm.products” in our ng-repeat. If you save these files and go back to your page, it should look like this:</p>

        <img src="/images/getting-started-project-4th.png" />

        <p>We don’t have any data yet, but this should show off some of the ng-if logic happening in the template. If we were not in prototype mode, we would be getting an error from a failed network request.</p>

        <p>Let’s feed some data into this page.</p>
